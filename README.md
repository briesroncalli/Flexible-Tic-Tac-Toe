### Flexible Tic-tac-Toe
#### *Ben Ries-Roncalli*
Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an 'O' or an 'X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.

In this variant of the traditional game, the users may select any board size between 3 and 25. The program keeps track of a running score between the players throughout the series of games.

Games are instances of the `tictactoe` class located in `tictactoe.h` and all of the associated functions required to play the game are located in `tictactoe.cpp`.
